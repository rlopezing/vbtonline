 TAGAlertaTDCV1 = Sign your credit card in permanent ink as soon as you receive it and destroy the old cards when they expire.

 TAGAlertaTDCV2 = Never allow anyone else to use your card. It is yours and yours alone.

 TAGAlertaTDCV3 = When making a purchase, ensure that the salesperson processes your transaction in your presence.

 TAGAlertaTDCV4 = Check your card when it is returned to you by the cashier to ensure that it is yours and that it has not been tampered with any way.

 TAGAlertaTDCV5 = Always retain your receipts so that you can check them against your statement.
 TAGAlertaTDCV6 = Notify card issuer of any change of address, so new cards/statements are not sent to the old mailing address.

 TAGAlertaTDCV7 = Should your card be stolen or is lost, inform card issuer immediately. Always keep card issuer (VBT Bank & Trust, Ltd., "The Bank") contact number at hand.

 TAGAlertaTDCV8 = Do not give any credit card information to individuals soliciting sales over the phone and/or by mail and/or email.

 TAGAlertaTDCV9 = If you're purchasing online, be sure to make your transaction through a Secure Server Transaction Web Site (better if the web site has been certified by VISA).

 TAGAlertaTDCV10 = Do not sign a blank charge slip, draw a line through the lines above the total amount and destroy any carbon and cancelled receipts.

 TAGAlertaTDCV11 =Avoid gambling, casinos and unknown web sites.

 TAGAlertaTDCV12 = If you receive any unknown purchase confirmation by SMS (cellular phone) and/or email from "The Bank", please contact us Immediately (Customer Service, Financial Advisor).

 TAGAlertaTDCV13 = Be aware of any email message that requests personal data—such as passwords, PINs, or your ID number—or sends you to a web site that asks for such information. These messages may involve the illegal practice of "spoofing," or forging an email address to resemble another, legitimate address and business. Remember to never send personal information via an email. If you have received an email that spoofs Visa, please notify Visa of the specifics of the illegal email.

 TAGAlertaTDCV14 =Visa will not call or e-mail you to request your personal account information. Visa call centers do not initiate outbound telemarketing calls. Consumers should not respond to any e-mails or phone calls with requests for any personal card information and are advised to immediately report the situation to local law enforcement as well as the financial institution that issued their card.

 TAGAlertaTDCV15 = The Cardholder will be liable to "The Bank" for failing to report unauthorized use of the Card. As soon as the Cardholder gives proper notice to "The Bank", liability for subsequent unauthorized sales and cash advances may cease.

 TAGAlertaTDCV16 =  The Cardholder is solely responsible for the correct use of the Card. The Cardholder assumes responsibilities for all charges and fees derived for the correct use of the Card. Any misuse of the Card will be the sole responsibility of the Cardholder.

 TAGAlertaTDCV17 = The use of your credit card by unauthorized third parties (e.g. due to loss, theft, forgery or use of data of the credit card while cardholder uses card online or in digital media) is the main risk the cardholder faces when using the card. The appropriation of the card by third parties facilitating its misuse may cause damage to one or more subjects participating in the credit card system (e. g. users, participating establishments and issuer). The repair of such damage arising from breach of your obligation/responsibility as cardholder to prevent such damages can result in liability claims to you as cardholder.
